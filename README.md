# PlayChess

A terminal-based chess game built in Python with a curses-powered text interface.

## Description

PlayChess is a two-player chess game that runs in the terminal, featuring a clean text-based user interface powered by Python's curses library. It implements standard chess rules including piece movement validation, pawn promotion, check detection, and move logging. Originally developed as a school project for NYJC J1 Computing Assignment.

## Features

- Full chess piece movement validation (King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn)
- Pawn special moves: first move double-step, diagonal capture, promotion to Queen
- Check detection with alert messages
- Move history logging to `moves.txt` with timestamps
- Debug mode for development and testing
- Text-based UI with curses library for clean terminal display
- Win condition detection (King capture)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- curses (Python standard library for terminal UI)
- datetime (for move timestamps)
- unittest (for testing)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/theprawnorganisation/playchess.git

# Navigate to project directory

```

No additional dependencies required - uses Python standard library only.

## Usage

# Run the game using Python
python main.py

# Or on Windows, use the batch file
run.bat

# Run tests
python -m unittest test_chess.py
```

### How to Play

1. The game displays an 8×8 chess board with Unicode chess symbols
2. Enter moves in the format `XY XY` where:
   - First `XY` is the start position (column, row)
   - Second `XY` is the end position (column, row)
   - Example: `01 03` moves a piece from position (0,1) to (0,3)
3. White player moves first, then players alternate turns
4. The game ends when a King is captured

## Demo

Run the game locally using `python main.py` in your terminal.
